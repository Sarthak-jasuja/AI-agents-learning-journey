# 🧠 Kaggle x Google – Generative AI 5-Day Intensive  

I’m thrilled to begin the **Kaggle 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google** starting **today**! 🚀  

Over the next five days, I’ll be diving deep into the world of **AI agents**, exploring how they think, act, and evolve — from foundational concepts to building production-ready multi-agent systems.  
This repository will serve as my **learning journal, notes, and code experiments** throughout the journey.

## 📅 Course Overview  

### 🗓 Day 1: Introduction to Agents  
Kickstarting with the **foundations of AI agents** — their defining characteristics, how **agentic architectures** differ from traditional LLM apps, and how they enable intelligent, autonomous systems.  

---

### 🗓 Day 2: Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP  
Exploring how AI agents can **take action** through external tools and APIs.  
I’ll also learn about the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — a framework for discovering and integrating tools seamlessly to expand agent capabilities.  

---

### 🗓 Day 3: Context Engineering — Sessions & Memory  
Learning how to build agents that **remember** past interactions and maintain context.  
The focus will be on implementing **short-term and long-term memory** to handle complex, multi-turn conversations and dynamic tasks.  

---

### 🗓 Day 4: Agent Quality  
Understanding how to **evaluate, monitor, and optimize** agent performance.  
This includes mastering **observability, logging, and tracing**, along with defining **key metrics** to ensure reliability and continuous improvement.  

---

### 🗓 Day 5: Prototype to Production  
Wrapping up by taking agents **from prototype to production**.  
I’ll learn how to **deploy and scale** AI agents effectively and explore **multi-agent systems** powered by the **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol**.  

---

## 🧩 Topics I’ll Be Exploring  
- Agentic architectures & autonomy  
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)  
- Context engineering & memory design  
- Observability & evaluation frameworks  
- Deployment strategies & multi-agent systems  

---

## 🎯 My Goal  
By the end of this 5-day journey, I aim to:  
- Build a working prototype of an intelligent, context-aware AI agent  
- Experiment with real-world integrations using MCP  
- Understand how to evaluate and optimize agent behavior for reliability and scalability

What languages is the SDK available in?\nhelpful_assistant > Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular open-source framework designed to simplify the end-to-end development and deployment of AI agents and multi-agent systems. It applies software development principles to AI agent creation, making it easier for developers to build, deploy, and orchestrate complex agentic architectures, from simple tasks to intricate workflows.\n\nThe ADK aims to provide developers with powerful and flexible tools for building in the rapidly evolving agent landscape. It offers precise control over agent behavior and orchestration, a rich tool ecosystem, and is designed for production-ready applications. While optimized for Gemini models and the Google ecosystem, the ADK is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, making it compatible with other frameworks. It can be deployed anywhere, from a local machine to the cloud, and is recommended to be deployed on Vertex AI Agent Engine Runtime for scalability.\n\nThe SDK is available in the following languages:\n*   **Python**\n*   **Go**\n*   **Java**\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = await runner.run_debug(\"What is the weather in saharanpur right now?\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T16:53:44.296214Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T16:53:44.297497Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T16:53:46.889174Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-10T16:53:44.297461Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T16:53:46.888250Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n ### Continue session: debug_session_id\n\nUser > What is the weather in saharanpur right now?\nhelpful_assistant > The weather in Saharanpur, India is currently experiencing clear skies with a temperature of 56°F (13°C).
